# Tekken 8 Movelist

The data for the character movelists is tracked by a Google Sheets spreadsheet. The spreadsheet can be accessed through the link [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qb2X92O86BvbR7C-aTkpbOAvJHJPS7bhLn3czrIXiP0/edit?usp=sharing).


## Credits

- Reddit user [cantbelieveudonethi5](https://www.reddit.com/user/cantbelieveudonethi5/), who made and shared png files for the inputs and move properties. I edited and converted some of those files to svg files for the move lists.
- [Tekken Warehouse](https://tekkenwarehouse.com/), which made the character renders easily accessible.
